# RN Release Notes: Assignment

## Brief

In this assignment, you will learn about the best practice in writing a GIT COMMIT message. When a software development reached a certain version iterations, there are two sources that help determine release notes. The first source is the User Stories, Features and Bug Fixes you have done and documented in a project management platform such as [Trello](trello.com) or [Atlassian JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). The second source will be coming from your GIT COMMIT message. Therefore, it is important to write meaningful commit message so that the development team is able to track the details of work done.

Read and discuss how you may improve writing GIT COMMIT message as a group by referring to the below resources:

- Git Tips and Commit Best Practice [Link](https://gist.github.com/luismts/495d982e8c5b1a0ced4a57cf3d93cf60)
- Git commit best practices [Link](https://medium.com/@nawarpianist/git-commit-best-practices-dab8d722de99)

Once you're done, answer the following questions.

1. How have you been writing your commit message?

```
// commit/draft-1/completed
```

2. Name three improvements you are committed to after reading the reference links.

```
// 1) Commit often after completing a working component
   2) Use Branches and write good commit messages
   3) Agree on A Workflow
```

3. After discussion with your group members, what other insights have you gained about GIT COMMIT best practices (if any).

```
//  Git commit with precise and descriptive header. For eg. [Fixbug] - Remove something from line 12, [Update] - Change API link
    Make small commits after completing a working component
```

## Submission Guidelines
